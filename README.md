# NeuralNetwork

## 1. Neural Network 

Neural network who  detects if it's a ***muffin or chihuahua or something else up to 4 classes in the actual code***. 🍪 🐶

Neural network qui détecte si c'est un chihuahua ou un muffin.

- 🏃 Run **neuralnetsgame.py** to execute the neural network

- ⏯️ Lancez **neuralnetsgame.py** pour exécuter le réseau de neurone. .

        The best version 👽
        
- The other version are obsolete 

## 2. Installation

DOWNLOAD ⏬ archive.zip to

The pack : chihuhua vs muffin, flowers or take you in picture.

- need to **rename** the image in test_set file: chihuhua.1.jpg to muffin.1000.jpg and the same for the dog 🐱 🐶
    
- rename the image with the file ***rename.py***

## 3. Wiki

Look at the wiki [here](https://github.com/regismeyssonnier/NeuralNetwork/wiki)


## 4. NeuralNetwors.cpp

There is also an implementation of a neural network in cpp. It manages by batch size 10 the training of 1000 shades of 2 images. And detect a ***square up left*** in ***image1*** and ***square down right*** in ***image2***.

## 5. MyCamNetwork

***Add your own model to detect you with tensorflow !!!!!!!!***

(Look at the wiki)[https://github.com/regismeyssonnier/NeuralNetwork/wiki/MyCamNetwork]

## 6. NNPro.py able to detect a cross or a cercle in an image

It's almost magic, it's a Neural Network which detects the image cross and circle at 100% in the folder Test.

The file best10.txt are a save of the NN with 100% detection score. You can create your own.
